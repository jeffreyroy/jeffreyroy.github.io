			Another chess-related website is <a href="http://www.chessgames.com/">chessgames.com</a>.  The chessgames site is a searchable collection of historical chess games.
		</p>
		<p>
			The site is clearly divided into subsections, with a header on top and sidebars for navigation.  The upper middle section of the site is a form with text input and drop-down selections.  The "Find Chess Games!" button appears to be a "submit" element.  At the bottom of the site is a navigation section with links to various subpages.
		</p>
		<p>
			Overall, I'd say the site is organized, but perhaps a bit too complicated for a new user.
